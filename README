What?
This is code to send then receive XML to Hoptoad's notifier API via .NET.

How?
This code was built using a Gateway pattern as described by Martin Fowler in Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture.

Usage is a snap:

(1) Edit the code to add your API-KEY from Hoptoad.

(2) Compile.

(3) Add a reference to the DLL.

(4) Call the Gateway's Notify method and pass in your exception.

To what extent?
Use it, copy it, fork it, whatever, as much as you want.
