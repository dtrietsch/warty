What?
This is code to send then receive XML to Hoptoad's notifier API via .NET.

How?
This code was built using a Gateway pattern as described by Martin Fowler in Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture.

Usage is a snap:

(1) Add a reference to the DLL.

(2) Call the Gateway's Notify method and pass in your api key, environment name, and exception.

To what extent?
Use it, copy it, fork it, whatever, as much as you want.
